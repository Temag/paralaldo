# paralaldo
This repository contains an image processing application designed to find a certain image within other images no matter the rotation (0, 90, 180, 270). It was then improved using OpenMP to apply low level concurrency that sped the process up considerably. This project was created for the Parallel Programming course at University of Guelph.

# Building the Project
Unfortunately this project was created a number of years ago in Visual Studio. The makefile was automatically generated by visual studio as well as some other settings. Also the data used to test the program was not provided to me so in its current state it does not run, it simple functions as an example of my coding style and abilities.

# Acknowledgements
The files that were used to test this program were provided by Professor Bill Gardner, he also provided me with assistance when things went wrong.
