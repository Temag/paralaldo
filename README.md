# paralaldo
This repository contains an image processing application designed to find a certain image within other images no matter the rotation (0, 90, 180, 270). It was then improved using OpenMP to apply low level concurrency that sped the process up considerably. This project was created for the Parallel Programming course at University of Guelph.

# Building the Project
This project was created in Visual Studio so the make file existed within visual studio. Opening the project in Visual Studio shoudl make it runable however the data used to test the program was not provided to me so without creating usable data the program does not do anything. I uploaded it simply as an example of my coding.

# Acknowledgements
The files that were used to test this program were provided by Professor Bill Gardner, he also provided me with assistance when things went wrong.
